## ðŸ“¦ Usage

```yaml
name: Example Workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  run-maestro:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout main repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Checkout maestro-action
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          repository: AARInternal/maestro-action
          token: ${{ secrets.MAESTRO_ACTIONS_TOKEN }}
          path: .github/actions/maestro-action

      - name: Run Maestro Action
        uses: ./.github/actions/maestro-action
        with:
          formula: "atomicContention"  # One of: atomicContention, memoryAccess, bankConflict, diagnoseOnly
          docker_image: "my-default-docker:latest"         # Optional if using Docker
          apptainer_image: "/path/to/default_apptainer.sif" # Optional if using Apptainer
          top_n: "10"                                       # Optional, defaults to 10
          create_pr: "true"                                # Optional, creates PR with changes
